                        <li>HTML is relatively easy to learn, making it accessible to beginners. Its simple syntax and

                    <ol>
                        <li>The most fundamental use of CSS is to style web pages. CSS allows you to control the
                            appearance of HTML elements, such as fonts, colors, spacing, borders, backgrounds, and more.
                            This is essential for creating visually appealing and consistent web designs.</li><br>
                        <li>CSS enables precise control over the layout of web content. You can use properties like
                            display, position, float, and flexbox to arrange elements on the page, control their
                            positioning, and create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
                        </li><br>
                        <li> CSS plays a central role in responsive web design. Media queries allow you to apply
                            different styles and layouts based on the screen size and device type, ensuring that your
                            web pages look and function well on both desktop and mobile devices.</li><br>

                <td>
                    <ol>
                        <li> CSS allows for a clear separation of content (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior
                            (JavaScript). This separation makes it easier to maintain and update different aspects of a
                            web project independently.</li><br>
                        <li>By using CSS, you can apply styles to multiple elements simultaneously. This efficiency
                            reduces the need for repetitive HTML code and inline styling, making your codebase cleaner
                            and more maintainable.</li><br>
                        <li>: CSS can be used to enhance accessibility by providing proper styling and visual cues. For
                            example, you can use CSS to highlight interactive elements, adjust text size, and improve
                            contrast for better readability.</li><br>

                            JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting, allowing developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It can be embedded directly into HTML documents and executed by web browsers on the client's device. Some common client-side tasks include form validation, user interface enhancements, and real-time updates without requiring a page reload.
                        </li><br>

                        <li>
                            JavaScript is a core technology in web development, complementing HTML and CSS. It enables developers to build feature-rich, responsive web applications by adding interactivity, handling user input, and making asynchronous requests to servers to retrieve or send data.
                        </li><br>

                        <li>
                            avaScript can be used to validate user input in web forms before the data is submitted to a server. This ensures data accuracy, prevents errors, and provides instant feedback to users, reducing the need for server-side validation.
                        </li><br>

                            JavaScript allows you to create dynamic and interactive web pages by responding to user actions in real-time. This leads to a more engaging and user-friendly experience.
                        </li><br>

                        <li>
                            JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for both front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) development. This flexibility enables developers to build entire web applications using a single language.
                        </li><br>

                        <li>
                            JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) that simplify web development and provide pre-built solutions for common tasks. This accelerates development and reduces the need for reinventing the wheel.
